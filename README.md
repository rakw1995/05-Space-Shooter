* DISCOUNT ENTERPRISE *
This is my space shooter that I decided to call "discount enterprise" because it kind of reminds me of what Star Trek would be like if it was the generic brand.

- The game uses a spaceship that is controlled by the mouse.
- Left mouse button clicks will allow the ship to shoot out a laser.
- The spaceship can shoot a laser (which is worth 10 damage) at an asteroid, whose "HP" is 100.
